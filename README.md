### About
<p align="justify">
Generative AI holds profound significance for healthcare by revolutionizing various aspects of medical research, diagnostics, and patient care. Its capacity to generate realistic and diverse data allows for the creation of synthetic datasets that augment the limited availability of real-world patient information, facilitating the development and validation of robust machine learning models. In this workshop, we will discuss two main pillars in healthcare AI: “trustworthiness” and “interpretability”. In the realm of healthcare, where data privacy and ethical considerations are paramount, the generation of synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) not only enhances trustworthiness by preserving individual privacy but also underscores the critical role of interpretability in ensuring transparent decision-making processes, particularly within medical applications. The workshop brings together a diverse community of generative AI researchers from various disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, and computer science, along with policymakers and industrial partners. Please join us on April 19 for this great event in the Luskin Hotel. Registration is required but free.

<!--
Synthetic data generation is a rapidly growing and highly interdisciplinary area that
draws much attention from both academia and industry. For the development of algorithmic
procedures for fraud detection and spam identification, as well as for the construction of AI-driven
models in industries like manufacturing and supply chain management, synthetic data
has become a valuable resource. The advantages of synthetic data include cost savings, increased
speed, agility, increased intelligence, and cutting-edge privacy. According to the Gartner report,
synthetic data will overshadow real data in training machine/deep learning models by 2030; see
Figure below. Additionally, the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1045416/10-breakthrough-technologies-2022/#synthetic-data-for-ai) named synthetic data as one of its top 10 game-changing innovations for 2022. Synthetic data is everywhere: image, text, graph and tabular data; it has different names: simulated data (for physical scientists); missing value imputation (for statisticians), and more recently, GAN (for computer scientists) etc. Therefore, it is believed that synthetic data generation will be an indispensable part of the next-generation machine learning workflow.

Despite numerous successful applications of synthetic data, its scientific foundation, e.g., the
tradeoff among fidelity, utility, and privacy, is still missing. Additionally, industrial standards
for generating and utilizing synthetic data are not fully developed. Furthermore, the privacy law on synthetic data is still in its infancy. 
Therefore, this workshop is to form a community of synthetic data researchers (from statistics, machine learning and mathematics), policymakers, and industrial partners, and bring them together to collaborate on the development of the theory, methodology, and algorithms needed to produce synthetic benchmark datasets and algorithms.

### Diversity Travel Awards

We are offering travel awards for attendees who will further the goal of increasing the diversity of the synthetic data  workforce. This includes persons from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, and persons with disabilities). You may also apply if you are faculty from an advanced degree granting institution with a high enrollment of underrepresented minority students, who would be interested in partnering with UCLA faculty to make symposium and workshop material available to their students. 

Travel awards will cover travel within the U.S., meals, and lodging.

[Click here](TBD) to apply for a Travel Award for the February 3, 2023 Lange Symposium. 

The travel award application deadline is **TBD**. Results will be announced December 16 2022.
